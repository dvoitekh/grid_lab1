# grid_lab1
Numeric solution for capacity-connected electrical circuits oscillations process via Rungeâ€“Kutta fourth-order method

## How to run

1. To get solution run `python lab1.py`. Results will be written into `output.out` file
1. To plot results (electric charge, amperage, voltage dependence of time) run `python lab1.py --plot`
